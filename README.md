# About Us

Gorilla Toolbox ( “We” or “Us”) is the sole owner of our Discord Bot (“Bot”) and all of the information collected on it. Our BOT collects information from our users in several ways through Discord servers where Bot is implemented.

By using our Bot, you consent to our Bot Privacy Policy.

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe We have inadvertently collected such information, please contact Us so We can either obtain parental consent or delete the information.

# Online Privacy Policy Only

This Policy applies only to information collected through our Bot and is not related to any information collected offline.

# Policy Updates

We may update this Policy at our discretion from time to time by posting a new version on our Bot. You should check our Bot occasionally to ensure any changes made are suitable for you.

# Which personal information is collected?

We collect the following user data to provide correct usage of functions in our Bot:
User ID,
User Nickname,
User Profile Picture,

We use that information to display your account details in our own system available on Our Bot.
All data collected by Us we store in a protected database. We will never share any of your data to third companies. You can contact with Us (through the official Gorilla Toolbox Discord server)  if you want to remove all your data from our Bot.
We also track your message content only during our games (captcha and guess the number). No message content is stored anywhere.

# Security
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect certain information that you submit. This type of technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone while it is being transmitted to our Bot. We work hard to ensure that our Bot  is secure and that we meet industry standards.


# Links to other sites
At our discretion We can add links (web links) to other websites from our Bot. These websites can be run by third parties with separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content, activities or privacy policies of those linked sites. We suggest you read the privacy policy of each and every site that you visit. We remind you that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by our Bot.
